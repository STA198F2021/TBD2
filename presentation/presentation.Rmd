# Initial Questions

---

## COVID-19 and Influenza

- In an effort to combat COVID-19, many public health measures have been taken since 2020 which have the capacity to affect other diseases.

- Have these measures (especially masks and lockdowns) impacted the spread of other diseases? To what extent and which diseases?

--

- To answer this question, we focused on influenza.

.pull-left[
```{r flu img, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: CDC."}
include_graphics("img/cdc influenza.png")
```
]
.pull-center[
- Influenza is a group of related viruses. Although COVID-19 and influenza viruses have many differences, they are both respiratory illnesses which spread similarly. 
- Additionally, influenza is one of the most common and deadly infectious diseases in the United States and has its own CDC monitoring tool.
]


---

## Investigation

- First, we pulled available data for flu hospitalizations and deaths from the CDC's FluView monitoring program.

--

- We then plotted these data over the years to prepare the data to test for significance.

## Stringency Index 

- describes restriction policies such as school closures, work space closing,
mask and vaccination policy

$${index}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^kI_j$$

- a good measure for strictness of restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic

# Linear Regression model using Stringency Index  

```{r linear model, echo=FALSE, cache = FALSE}
merged_5_states%>%
  filter(YEAR == 2020)%>%
  ggplot(aes(`Stringency_Index`, `NUM INFLUENZA DEATHS`))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~STATE)
```
- A negative correlation exists between Stringency Index and number of deaths due to influenza. A linear regression model was chosen to further investigate this relationship.

---

# Statistical Results of the Linear Regresssion Model

- This linear regression model is fitted with stringency index as an explanatory variable and the weekly number of deaths due to influenza as a response variable.
```{r lmodel, echo=FALSE}
lmodel<-lm(`NUM INFLUENZA DEATHS`~`Stringency_Index`, data = merged_5_states)
lmodel%>%
  tidy(conf.int=TRUE)
```
- A similar linear regression model is fitted using the percentage of influenza infections out of total patients as a response variable. 
```{r model patients stringency,echo=FALSE, cache = FALSE}
lmodel<-lm(`%UNWEIGHTED ILI`~`Stringency_Index`, data = merged_5_states)
lmodel%>%
  tidy(conf.int=TRUE)
```

---
# Conclusion 

- The data demonstrates that the spread of influenza has been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that this difference is explainable by the public health measures put in place to stop COVID-19.

- The impact of the flu was reduced by being during the coronavirus pandemic  by increased stringency, when compared to the years before the COVID-19 pandemic.

- One unexpected result was that the number of deaths appeared to be more significantly affected by these variables than the hospitalization rate.

- The implications of this data could be explored further by comparing effects of measures across countries and globally, as well as comparing the effects of these measures on other diseases.

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r penguins-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(penguins), format = "html")
```

---

## Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Danielle Navarro, Percolate."}
include_graphics("img/watercolour_sys02_img32_percolate.jpg")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

## Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{index}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{i=1}^kI_j$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

## Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect the majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
